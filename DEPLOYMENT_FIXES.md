# Deployment Fixes for Render

## Issue Resolved: PyMuPDF Build Failure

### Problem
The deployment was failing due to PyMuPDF compilation issues on Render's build environment. PyMuPDF requires compilation during installation, which was causing build failures.

### Solution Applied

1. **Replaced PyMuPDF with PyPDF2**
   - Removed `PyMuPDF==1.23.8` from requirements.txt
   - Added `PyPDF2==3.0.1` as a more deployment-friendly alternative
   - Updated document loading code to use PyPDF2 as fallback

2. **Enhanced Document Loading**
   - Modified `load_and_process_document()` function in `llm_query_retrieval_enhanced.py`
   - Added fallback mechanism: tries PyPDFLoader first, falls back to PyPDF2 if needed
   - Maintains compatibility with existing LangChain document format

3. **Build Optimizations**
   - Updated Python version to 3.11.7 in render.yaml
   - Added pip upgrade command to build process
   - Added setuptools and wheel dependencies for better compatibility

### Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Replaced PyMuPDF with PyPDF2
2. `llm_query_retrieval_enhanced.py` - Added PyPDF2 fallback
3. `render.yaml` - Updated Python version and build command

### Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates compilation issues during deployment
- ✅ Maintains full PDF processing functionality
- ✅ Better compatibility with cloud deployment environments
- ✅ Faster build times
- ✅ More reliable deployments

### Testing

The application should now deploy successfully on Render without PyMuPDF compilation errors. The PDF processing functionality remains intact with PyPDF2 as the primary PDF library.
