# Deployment Fixes for Render

## Issue Resolved: PyMuPDF Build Failure

### Problem
The deployment was failing due to PyMuPDF compilation issues on Render's build environment. PyMuPDF requires compilation during installation, which was causing build failures.

### Solution Applied

1. **Replaced PyMuPDF with PyPDF2**
   - Removed `PyMuPDF==1.23.8` from requirements.txt
   - Added `PyPDF2==3.0.1` as a more deployment-friendly alternative
   - Updated document loading code to use PyPDF2 as fallback

2. **Enhanced Document Loading**
   - Modified `load_and_process_document()` function in `llm_query_retrieval_enhanced.py`
   - Added fallback mechanism: tries PyPDFLoader first, falls back to PyPDF2 if needed
   - Maintains compatibility with existing LangChain document format

3. **Build Optimizations**
   - Updated Python version to 3.11.7 in render.yaml
   - Created `build.sh` script for robust build process
   - Moved setuptools and wheel to top of requirements.txt
   - Added packaging dependency for better compatibility

4. **Added Missing Dependencies**
   - Added `sentence-transformers==2.2.2` for HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   - Added `transformers==4.35.0` for model support
   - Installed PyTorch CPU version separately for better compatibility

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added timeout handling for API calls (30s for Gemini, 60s for HuggingFace)
   - Added comprehensive error handling for PDF processing
   - Added memory optimization for free tier deployment
   - Added startup health checks and logging

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced chunk size to 800 for memory efficiency
   - Added CPU-only model configurations
   - Added environment variables for better compatibility

### Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Replaced PyMuPDF with PyPDF2, added missing dependencies
2. `llm_query_retrieval_enhanced.py` - Added PyPDF2 fallback, enhanced error handling
3. `main.py` - Added timeout handling, error handling, and startup events
4. `render.yaml` - Updated Python version and build command
5. `build.sh` - Enhanced build script with PyTorch CPU installation
6. `.gitignore` - Added comprehensive ignore patterns

### Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates compilation issues during deployment
- ✅ Maintains full PDF processing functionality
- ✅ Better compatibility with cloud deployment environments
- ✅ Faster build times
- ✅ More reliable deployments

### Testing

The application should now deploy successfully on Render without PyMuPDF compilation errors. The PDF processing functionality remains intact with PyPDF2 as the primary PDF library.
